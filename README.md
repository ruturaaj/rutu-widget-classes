#Rutu's WP Widget Classes

WP Widget Classes is a no-fancy Plugin that allows you to set your own custom CSS classes for any Widget you publish in WordPress Widget Area. A new Text box is added to the bottom of each Widget where you can specify name(s) of your CSS classes. Separate multiple CSS Class Names by Space to avoid conflicts.

###FAQ:

**Do I need to make changes in my Theme files?**

No. You don't need to make changes in your Theme files. The Plugin will take care of adding classes automatically.

**Will this plugin replace current Widget Classes of my Theme?**

No. Plugin does not touch the current Widget classes (if any). It will "append" the new CSS Classes you defined to the current Widget Classes.
